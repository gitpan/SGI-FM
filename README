This directory contains an extension module to allow Perl5 programs
access the Iris Font Manager library supplied by SGI with the IRIX system.

This module requires the GL and the FM library to be installed
(e.g. the files /usr/lib/libfm.so and /usr/lib/libgl.so, which are
part of the eoe1.sw.gfx_lib package in IRIX 5.2, it may very well be
under another name in other versions of IRIX)

This package uses MakeMaker in a standard way to build its Makefile.
In order to build it do the following:

1. Unpack the source into a directory

2. change the current directory to the source directory

3. run "perl Makefile.PL"

4. run "make"

5. run "make install" as someone who can write to your Perl library
   directory.

The current implementation is NOT complete - functions are being added
to it as I need them.  If you want me to add a particular function
from the FM library then please drop me a note and I'll try to do what
you want.

Most of the functions are extremly trivial to support so you shouldn't
be too scared to try to add what you need yourself, but please let me
know about what you do so I can maintain a single version for the
benefit of all users (all two of them :-).

Usage is stright-forward - just add a 'use SGI::FM' command before using
any of the functions then call them as you would call FM functions
from C, prefixing the function names with 'SGI::FM::'.
